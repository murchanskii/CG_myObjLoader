# CG_myObjLoader
A small university project (OpenGL) using tinyobjloader and stb libraries

## Done:
+ Model preview (model is loading from 'models.ini' file)
+ Mouse support (rotation + scale)
+ Multiple global lightning
+ ONLY diffuse texture support

## Known issues
- Some models can be loaded inverted by certain axis
- No specular and normal texture support
- ONLY Ka, Kd, Ks, Ns, d, illum from .mtl file are supported
